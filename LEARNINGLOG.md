# Learning Log

- In the first half of the project, I used the wrong syntax for comments in my HTML and CSS files when committing to GitHub.

I didn't use the correct langauage like Updated or Removed at the begining of the poject. The comment were not detailed either.

- I didnâ€™t notice this right away, so incorrect comments were present in the earlier commits.
