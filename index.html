    <h1>About The Band</h1>
    <p>Concrete Handbag is aa four-piece band combining elements of noise, post-punk, and dream pop. Formed in 2021, the
        group built its sound around layered guitars, lo-fi textures, and a shared interest in the tension between
        melody and distortion.
        Their music is shaped by city life — cold spaces, late nights, and overlooked corners — and explores themes of
        detachment, repetition, and quiet resistance. Drawing influence from underground scenes past and present,
        Concrete Handbag avoids nostalgia in favor of something more current, more unsettled.
        Their debut EP, Sidewalk Etiquette, was recorded on borrowed gear in a basement studio and released
        independently. Since then, they’ve played shows in DIY spaces and small venues, steadily growing a following
        through word of mouth and honest performances.
        Concrete Handbag is less about spectacle and more about mood — built on tone, texture, and the spaces in
        between.</p>
